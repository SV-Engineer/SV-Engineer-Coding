# SV-Engineer-Coding
This repository is intended to be a hub for knowledge regarding the Raspberry Pi Coding lessons. The intent is to teach embedded C and communicate effective coding through organization. This will be achieved through the implentation of a 2-player pong game on a 3.5 inch LCD.

# Prerequisites
1. Comfortable with computers
    - Comfortable with typing on a key board
    - Able to navigate with a mouse and willing to learn how to do so without a mouse
2. Good with basic Algebra
    - Solving an equation for a variable e.g. y = 2x for x = 3.
    - Understanding of the cartesian coordinate plane.
3. Patience and a willingness to try again when it doesn't quite work out the first time or even the fifth time.

# What you need
* The device chosen for this undertaking is the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ found here on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ELEMENT-Element14-Raspberry-Pi-Motherboard/dp/B07P4LSDYV/ref=sr_1_3?crid=28BY8MW2NG71B&keywords=raspberry+pi+3b%2B&qid=1699111517&sprefix=raspberry+pi+3b%2B%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-3). If this seller (no affiliation, just the one I purchased from) is out of stock, try searching for it on Amazon or at Microcenter.
* A power supply for the Raspberry Pi (one of the following):
  - This [one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BTHNW9W?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) includes a protective case.
  - Something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Supply-Adapter-Listed/dp/B00MARDJZ4/ref=sr_1_3?crid=7SEYIQKMUVLY&keywords=raspberry+pi+3+model+b%2B+power+supply&qid=1699112693&s=electronics&sprefix=raspberry+pi+3+model+b%2B+power%2Celectronics%2C85&sr=1-3) also works.
  - If you can find something on sale and want to save a few dollars go for it. The only requirement is that it is compatible with "Raspberry Pi 3 Model b+"
* A [GPIO expansion board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BV6ZHV37/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* A micro SD card
  - Can be 16 or 32 GB.
  - Instructions on how to install the Raspbian OS can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
  - If you don't want to deal with it you can either buy a 32 GB micro SD card with the OS preloaded for $5 from me or trade me a 32 GB micro SD you have already in exchange for a 32 GB micro SD with the OS preloaded.
* An HDMI cable to connect to it.
* A USB computer mouse.
* A USB computer keyboard.
* A monitor or tv with an HDMI port to plug it into.

Assuming you have the last 4 items on the above list already, the rest should cost in the range of $60-$80. You may or may not be able to find these items on sale. The Model B+ should be the bulk of the cost running somewhere between $40 and $55. I'd hesitate to buy it for more than that. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is effectively a micro computer and at the end of the day it's computing power is not so good such that it is worth more than $55 max.

# Disclaimer
I can do online lessons if prefferred after the first assessment. Students that are minors must have an adult nearby for the duration of the lesson. I will come to you and I must insist a legal guardian be in reasonably close proximity for the duration of the lesson. I am not willing to travel further than 5 miles from the Spring Creek Parkway - Shiloh Rd area.

# Pricing
Currently I am offering 2 options. More options may become available. Realistically the first option will be sufficient for most as a lot of coding is about self study and then getting feedback on the work completed thus far. I offer 1 hour sessions in the event that extra time is needed to hammer down ideas from previous weeks. There is not a set timeline of course and whatever pace the student works at is fine.

Payable via cash, Venmo, or Paypal.
* $10 gets 30 minutes per week. Saturday or Sunday.
* $15 gets 1 hour per week. Saturday or Sunday.

# Note
To become effective at coding, it does require the student to practice. No one is good at coding. It is a skill that requires persistence and discipline. The lessons are designed to provide some modicum of structure to said pratice, however if the only coding done for the week is done during the lesson itself, it will be hard to see reasonable progress.

# Lesson Overview
## Goal
To develop a 2 player pong game on a 3.5 inch LCD screen using the C language.

## Road Map
This roadmap is not yet finalized and some tweaks may come into effect. This is a rough draft and the overall events contained within will not change but the sequence may. Each item listed does not necessarily comprise an entire lesson.
0. Assessment. The first lesson will need to be a 30 minute in person assessment of the student to ensure they are comfortable enough with technology to make the lessons worthwhile for everyone involved. I cannot say at this time that I wish to put together lessons on typing and basic computer use as there are far better resources available online for free via youtube and elsewhere. I do not want your money to be wasted in the event that the course I am defining is too advanced; or in some cases too simple. This assessment will be $5 only. The $5 fee is all you should expect to pay for the first session.
1. Setup of hardware.
2. Setup of software.
3. Learning how to compile code and print helpful messages to the screen.
4. Variables and functions.
5. Boolean algebra and how it enables us to control external devices.
6. GPIO and using perihperals.
7. Learning how to make the LCD screen update.
8. Learning how to interpret and use data from a joystick.
9. Final project.
